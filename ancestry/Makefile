## Notes: this step merges the {African American and African} and {East Asian and Other Asian or Pacific Islander} ancestries.
##        this decision was made by the PLCO analysis group. this behavior can be controlled from within GRAF but, as the ancestries
##        needed to be manually modified in other ways too, I've kept the modification outside of GRAF for clarity.

## Notes: this step manually overrides the actual GRAF ancestry estimates for three subjects that were typed on multiple platforms.
##        these three subjects were on the border between two admixed groups and different chip compositions on different platforms led
##        to different estimates. in two cases, this step is actually rendered unnecessary by the following step (merging groups), but
##        for recordkeeping the modifications are still made. for the remaining subject, the switch is from Hispanic1 -> African American,
##        which is still necessary. per the decision of the PLCO analysis group, the final ancestry for conflicting subjects is taken from
##        the denser array; as the conflict always happens to be between Oncoarray and the Omni{2.5/5} arrays, the Oncoarray is the only
##        chip that requires changing
